Task T2 – Improve input handling

The current task manager works, but it crashes or behaves badly when the user enters incorrect input.
Update the application so it handles invalid input gracefully instead of crashing.

The program should:
Not crash when the user enters wrong input
Show clear and helpful error messages
Continue running after an error and return to the main menu

Handle at least the following cases:
User enters non-numeric input for the menu choice
User enters invalid input for task priority
User enters an invalid date format or invalid date
User tries to complete or delete a task ID that does not exist

All existing features must continue to work exactly as before.
