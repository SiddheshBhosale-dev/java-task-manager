Task ID: T1
Task Type: bug_fix

Problem:
When the Task Manager application is restarted, task IDs start again from 1.
This causes duplicate task IDs for tasks that were created in earlier runs.

Expected Behavior:
Task IDs must continue from the last saved task.
The next task ID should be calculated based on the tasks loaded from disk.

Constraints:
- Existing functionality must not break
- Add, view, complete, and delete operations should behave the same
- The fix must work across application restarts
- Corrupted or empty persistence files should not crash the app
